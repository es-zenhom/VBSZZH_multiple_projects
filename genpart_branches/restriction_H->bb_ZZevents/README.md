# VBSZZH Genpart Restriction

This repository contains a C++ script, `VBSZZH_genpart_restriction.C`, which is part of a larger project focused on the analysis of Vector Boson Scattering (VBS) and Zh production. This script specifically deals with the restriction of Higgs boson decaying into bb and ZZ events.

## Project Context

The `VBSZZH_genpart_restriction.C` script is a component of a larger suite of tools and scripts used in the analysis of data from high-energy physics experiments. The overarching goal of these experiments is to better understand the fundamental particles and forces of the universe, with a particular focus on the Higgs boson and its interactions.

In this context, the script plays a crucial role in filtering and preparing data for further analysis. It specifically targets events where the Higgs boson decays into bb and ZZ particles, a phenomenon of great interest in the field of particle physics.

## Script Functionality

The script reads data from a ROOT file, a standard file format in high-energy physics research. It then applies a series of restrictions or filters to the data, selecting only those events that meet specific criteria related to the decay of the Higgs boson.

The script is built on the ROOT data analysis framework, a comprehensive system for large-scale data analysis developed by CERN. ROOT provides a wide array of functionalities, including statistical analysis, data visualization, and data storage.

## Usage

To use this script, you need to have the ROOT framework installed on your system. You can then run the script on your data file using the following command:

```bash
root -l VBSZZH_genpart_restriction.C
```

Please note that this script is part of a larger data analysis pipeline and may require specific data formats and structures to function correctly. It is recommended to have a solid understanding of the data and the overall project context before using this script.

## About the Author

The script is developed by Eslam Zenhom, a data analyst with a background in high-energy physics. With experience in data analysis, statistical modeling, and programming, Eslam Zenhom is skilled in transforming complex data into meaningful insights with a deep understanding of the ROOT framework and the data structures used in high-energy physics, and has applied this knowledge in the development of this script and others like it.
