# VBSZZH Multiple Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects related to Vector Boson Scattering (VBS) and Zh production. The projects are primarily focused on data analysis and jet reconstruction in high energy physics.

## Jet Reconstruction

One of the main components of this repository is the `Jet_reconstruction` project. This project is focused on the reconstruction of jets in high energy physics experiments. The main script for this project is `VBSZZH_genpart_restriction_Jet_reconstruction.C`.

### VBSZZH_genpart_restriction_Jet_reconstruction.C

This script is written in C++ and is used for the reconstruction of jets in high energy physics experiments. It uses the ROOT data analysis framework, which is a powerful tool for large scale data analysis.

The script starts by loading the necessary ROOT libraries and setting up the input and output files. It then defines several histograms for different variables of interest, such as the jet pt, eta, and phi.

The main part of the script is a loop over all events in the input file. For each event, it applies a series of cuts to select the relevant particles. It then uses these particles to reconstruct the jets.

The output of the script is a ROOT file containing the histograms of the variables of interest. This file can be used for further analysis or for producing plots.

## Data Analysis

As a data analyst with a background in high energy physics, I have a strong understanding of statistical analysis methods and the ability to interpret complex data sets. This repository showcases my ability to handle large scale data, apply sophisticated analysis techniques, and draw meaningful conclusions.
